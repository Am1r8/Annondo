# Annondo

An app made with Flutter. This app helps students to find their school announcements, Annondo helps students that are not present in school know about the events of school, or even if they forgot about a specific event they can just open the app and find the announcements.

This app is currently only available for Thornhill secondary school, soon other schools will be added to the YRDSB region.

With ANNONDO you can read all the announcements and never forget what happened that day.
ANNONDO is the app you need to remember your announcements :)
## How does it work?!
when teachers import the announcement of the day, you can view and never forget about it.
each school will have a specific password and without the password and the code that is attached to that password, you cannot view the school's announcements.
Only teachers can change the announcements and they are predetermined.


## Available on!
